Links to definitions and documentation for APIs used within GDI

GDI needs to support a diverse range of deployments, and different products from the starter kit maybe replaced. As such there is a need to move from a product defined to API defined infrastructure within GDI. This repo is therefore a place to link to the API specifications, and / or associated standard specifications.
